## Header Component

- [ ] Add functionality to highlight the selected navigation item in the header component using `routerLinkActive="active-link"`.
  - Ensure the `active-link` class applies the desired color/style to the selected item.
  - Test the behavior for both desktop and mobile navigation menus.

## Stencil and Theming

- [ ] Implement a theming system for the application using Stencil.
  - Define a central theme configuration with properties like `primary`, `secondary`, and other color variables.
  - Replace hardcoded colors in HTML and CSS with references to the theme variables.
  - Ensure the theme configuration is dynamic, allowing the central theme to be updated and propagate changes throughout the application.
  - Test the theming system to ensure all components respond correctly to theme changes.
